# Profile Component Refactoring

This folder contains a refactored version of the Profile component with modular architecture.

## File Structure

- `/profile/ProfileNew.jsx` - Main component that handles tab navigation
- `/profile/common/` - Common UI components
  - `FormElements.jsx` - Form components (FormInputField, ToggleSwitch, etc.)
  - `IconsNew.jsx` - SVG icons for use across components
- `/profile/tabs/` - Individual tab panel components
  - `BusinessDetailsPanel.jsx` - Business information tab
  - `CreateLoyaltyPointsPanel.jsx` - Loyalty points tab
  - `InvoiceEditPanel.jsx` - Invoice editing tab
  - `BusinessWebsitePanel.jsx` - Website configuration tab
  - `AccessControlsPanel.jsx` - Access control tab
  - `SubscriptionPanel.jsx` - Subscription management tab

## How to Use

To use the new refactored version:

1. Rename `ProfileNew.jsx` to `Profile.jsx` (or update imports where Profile is used)
2. Rename `IconsNew.jsx` to `Icons.jsx`

## Benefits of This Structure

- **Modularity**: Each tab is in its own file, making it easier to maintain
- **Reusability**: Common components are separated and can be reused across the app
- **Readability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and navigate
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one tab don't affect others, reducing potential bugs
- **Performance**: Code-splitting becomes easier with this modular structure

## Implementation Notes

- Components maintain the same styling and functionality as the original
- All state management is contained within each component
- No external dependencies were added during refactoring
